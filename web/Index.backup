As with past conversions, Drew has played a critical role in this process by not only figuring out how we can accomplish this migration but also automating large pieces of it making the migration of over 40 thousand nodes actually possible.”</p>

After the writers entered their stories, the system compiled them into pdfs that were sent to the hotel, printed and stuffed under the guests' doors before 6 a.m. </p>

											<p>While the goal of this migration was more than just an exact transfer of sites/pages to Drupal 8, the initial step was a script to create the sites, determine the currently used pages and elements and setup Drupal 8 to begin the look & feel changes. For each site the database and tables were created, configuring Apache and Drupal configuration file were made, creating a node (page) and mapping node ids and aliases to keep navigation intact were done. The next step involved rewriting dozens of external applications as Drupal modules while the remainder of the team updated content and integrated new content taking advantage of Drupal 8 types and cards. In all, the final product involved around 180 sites and 30,000 pages.</p>

Don't feel too bad for them, these partners all had their own jets! I was hired to build an application that allowed partners to view real-time images of the slides and organize them into the "story” the partner wanted to tell. When they were done, a presentation was created for them to download and print remotely, but not edit.
