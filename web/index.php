          <h1>What makes me so special?</h1>
          <p>
            I'm a graduate of Michigan State University with simultaneous
            degrees in computer science, industrial psychology and minor in art
            history. I began my career at Accenture, followed by creating dozens
            of web-based applications and then helping to start what was for a
            short time a billion-dollar startup. After living the super-fast
            paced life of a consultant and software architect through the
            booming of the Internet, I now live a quieter, but nonetheless
            technically challenging, life running my software business, Sea
            Quinn, from an 80 acres forest in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Life
            on the shores of Lake Superior is unmatched with vast beaches in the
            summer and winters with over 200 inches of snow. The life of skiing
            and snowshoeing in the winter and hiking and swimming in the summer
            are shared with my wife, Amy, and our two dogs, Wondermutt the
            Australian cattle dog and Maisy the Rottweiler.
          </p>
          <h4>Why Sea Quinn?</h4>
          <p>
            Sea Quinn was the name of my dad's boat. So many great memories that
            are now memorialized with my company name.

                  "Every few years we attempt the impossible. We take our fully
                  functioning, yet somewhat dated website, and we migrate the
                  content into a new version of the site. This year we didn't
                  just start migrating content, we also started the process that
                  will rewrite the underlying framework that powers the NMU
                  website. As with past conversions, Drew has played a critical
                  role in this process by not only figuring out how we can
                  accomplish this migration but also automating large pieces of
                  it making the migration of over 40 thousand nodes actually
                  possible."

                  "Working remotely and staying remote for a good part of the
                  previous year was challenging for everyone on the team. Our
                  normal office environment and processes were upended by an
                  unprecedented pandemic. Regardless of this, Drew has embraced
                  working remotely and even thrived in this new environment.
                  Through his use of technology and willingness to initiate
                  communication with the team, Drew has become one of the
                  primary reasons why we can continue working at a high level
                  regardless of where our individual offices are located. Beyond
                  being able to take the lead on a highly technical project,
                  which Drew has certainly done, being able to effectively
                  communicate with everyone on the team and leverage their
                  strengths to advance a project continues to be one of Drew's
                  invaluable assets."
