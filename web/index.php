          <h1>What makes me so special?</h1>
          <p>
            I'm a graduate of Michigan State University with simultaneous
            degrees in computer science, industrial psychology and minor in art
            history. I began my career at Accenture, followed by creating dozens
            of web-based applications and then helping to start what was for a
            short time a billion-dollar startup. After living the super-fast
            paced life of a consultant and software architect through the
            booming of the Internet, I now live a quieter, but nonetheless
            technically challenging, life running my software business, Sea
            Quinn, from an 80 acres forest in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Life
            on the shores of Lake Superior is unmatched with vast beaches in the
            summer and winters with over 200 inches of snow. The life of skiing
            and snowshoeing in the winter and hiking and swimming in the summer
            are shared with my wife, Amy, and our two dogs, Wondermutt the
            Australian cattle dog and Maisy the Rottweiler.
          </p>
          <h4>Why Sea Quinn?</h4>
          <p>
            Sea Quinn was the name of my dad's boat. So many great memories that
            are now memorialized with my company name.

            "The unchanged passion of my life has been to take ideas and make
            them reality. Whether they are technical innovations or things made
            of wood, I've got the expertise to make it happen."
