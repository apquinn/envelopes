          <h1>What makes me so special?</h1>
          <p>
            I'm a graduate of Michigan State University with simultaneous
            degrees in computer science, industrial psychology and minor in art
            history. I began my career at Accenture, followed by creating dozens
            of web-based applications and then helping to start what was for a
            short time a billion-dollar startup. After living the super-fast
            paced life of a consultant and software architect through the
            booming of the Internet, I now live a quieter, but nonetheless
            technically challenging, life running my software business, Sea
            Quinn, from an 80 acres forest in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Life
            on the shores of Lake Superior is unmatched with vast beaches in the
            summer and winters with over 200 inches of snow. The life of skiing
            and snowshoeing in the winter and hiking and swimming in the summer
            are shared with my wife, Amy, and our two dogs, Wondermutt the
            Australian cattle dog and Maisy the Rottweiler.
          </p>
          <h4>Why Sea Quinn?</h4>
          <p>
            Sea Quinn was the name of my dad's boat. So many great memories that
            are now memorialized with my company name.

                  accomplish this migration but also automating large pieces of

                  "Working remotely and staying remote for a good part of the
                  previous year was challenging for everyone on the team. Our
                  normal office environment and processes were upended by an

                activities matched to their prior ones and local weather all in
                their preferred language. After the writers entered their
                stories, the system compiled them into pdfs that were sent to
                the hotel, printed and stuffed under the guests' doors before 6

							<p>While the goal of this migration was more than just an exact transfer of sites/pages to Drupal 8, the initial step was a script to create the sites, determine the currently used pages and elements and setup Drupal 8 to begin the look & feel changes. For each site the database and tables were created, configuring Apache and Drupal configuration file were made, creating a node (page) and mapping node ids and aliases to keep navigation intact were done. The next step involved rewriting dozens of external applications as Drupal modules while the remainder of the team updated content and integrated new content taking advantage of Drupal 8 types and cards. In all, the final product involved around 180 sites and 30,000 pages.</p>

						<h4>Epotec</h4>
						<p>Epotec harnessed the resources of the Internet to enhance the effectiveness of behavioral health services. Epotec combined ingenuity and technology in Web-based interactive programs that help people lead happier, more productive lives by building skills and solving problems securely and privately. </p>
						<div class="hidden-experience hidden">
							<p>More than 40 clients made our programs available to more than 700 companies and about 30 million people.</p>
							<p>I was brought in as Epotec's seventh employee to architect and manage the delivery of their primary product by an outsourced team. As the product reached completion, I was responsible for bringing technology in-house. As vice president of technology, my responsibilities included putting together a 50-person development team, budgeting, managing venture capital partner expectations, but most importantly, understanding the needs of our broadening industry impact and ensuring our products were on target. </p>

						<h4>Online certification tracking system (Dearborn Financial Services)</h4>
						<p>How do large companies manage employees who have specialized certifications requirements and what happens to the company if the certifications expire? </p>
						<div class="hidden-experience hidden">
							<p>For starters, if companies have employees with expired certifications, such as Series-7 financial certifications, they are heavily fined. Dearborn Financial Services saw an opportunity and hired me to lead of team of six to build a system that track the neccesary certification requirements for each employee, notifying them when training was required and provided a link to the necessary materials. In the event an employee became at risk of falling out of compliance, the system would notify managers in a timely manner. </p>

						<h4>Brinson Partners Presentation Management System</h4>
						<p>In the world of Brinson Partners, making a presentation to a client that contains misinformation is a potential financial disaster.</p>
						<div class="hidden-experience hidden">
							<p>In order to mitigate this, all slides were created in the central office and no other content is allowed. In the past, the partner had to fly to the Chicago office to put their presentation together, which was then printed, bound and shipped to the location the presentation would take place. Don't feel too bad for them, these partners all had their own jets! I was hired to build an application that allowed partners to view real-time images of the slides and organize them into the "story" the partner wanted to tell. When they were done, a presentation was created for them to download and print remotely, but not edit. In addition, stories could be saved and when opened later, for another client perhaps, the system would inform the partner if any of the original slides had been updated.</p>
